        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
            The Blue Velvet Lounge was a small bar located in downtown Madison, WI, well-known among students and locals alike. It gained recognition as one of the first establishments in the area to host a Latin Night, fostering a vibrant community atmosphere. My collaboration with the lounge began through a professional connection with the owner, who sought graphic design support for various projects. This partnership started with creating Snapchat Geofilters and eventually expanded to include rebranding their logo, showcasing our strong and collaborative working relationship.

        <h2>Snapchat Geofilters</h2>
        <div class="picGrid align-items-center">
            <img style="width: 80%; margin: 50px;" src="images/works/bvl_filters.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>
            Each filter was launched on a weekly rotation to coincide with the Latin Night event, held every Thursday from 9 PM to 2 AM. Despite the Lounge’s capacity of 160, the engagement statistics for the filters were remarkably high. On average, each filter was used over 300 times and reached an audience of more than 5,000 viewers, demonstrating the event’s popularity to engage with Snapchat users.

        <h2>Logo Rebranding</h2>

        <p>
            This project was a personal endeavor driven by a desire to modernize the branding of Blue Velvet Lounge. After reviewing the bar's existing website and logo, I took the initiative to redesign the logo with a sleeker, more contemporary aesthetic. The updated design features a simplified martini glass paired with the Gotham font to create a professional and minimalist impression.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Designing geofilters and the logo for Blue Velvet allowed me to refine and further develop my skills in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. As I was relatively new to the field of graphic design, the process involved extensive research and iterative trial and error. Ultimately, this experience enhanced my independence and strengthened my ability to meet deadlines while effectively addressing customer needs.
