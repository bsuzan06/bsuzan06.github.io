        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
            During my undergraduate studies, I served as a Graphic Designer and Web Developer for Lambda Theta Phi Latin Fraternity, Inc. One of my key projects was designing a logo for the fraternity's chapter at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, which is now featured across all their digital platforms. In addition to the logo, I contributed to various graphic design projects and outreach campaigns. Collaborating closely with the organization’s members allowed me to create content that effectively branded the chapter while aligning with their goals. To ensure consistency and compliance, I adhered to the fraternity’s National Branding Guide in all my designs.
        </p>

        <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
        <div class="picGrid align-items-center">
            <img style="margin: 50px; width: 50%;" src="images/works/GammaTheta_V2.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>
            The current logo for the organization was designed to effectively brand the chapter. It incorporates the organization’s official colors and features an outline of the state, subtly encrusted with ice to represent the chapter's alias, "The Arctic Asylum." This design encapsulates both the identity and spirit of the chapter.
        </p>

        <div class="picGrid align-items-center">
            <img style="width: 70%; margin:50px;" src="images/works/banner_fb.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>
            Following the university's guidelines, I edited and incorporated an image of Bucky the Badger along with the organization's name to create a Facebook banner for a private group. Since the image was used in a non-commercial context, it qualifies as fair use of copyrighted content.
        </p>

        <div class="picGrid align-items-center">
            <img style="width: 70%; margin: 50px;" src="images/works/lambda_shirts.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>
            These shirts were designed for sale and distribution to members nationwide, with proceeds being used to fund events for the chapter at the University of Wisconsin. Both designs incorporate key elements of the organization's identity, including their official flower, the white carnation, and their nickname, "Lambdas." In accordance with the organization's paraphernalia guidelines, the designs were restricted to the colors brown and white. The shirts were met with great enthusiasm and well-received by the members.
        </p>

        <h2>Digital Outreach</h2>
        <div class="picGrid align-items-center">
            <img style="width: 70%; margin: 50px;" src="images/works/FA17_Informational.jpg" alt="">
            <img style="width: 70%; margin: 50px;" src="images/works/seductiveRitmo5.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>
            These flyers represent the type of outreach promoted across social media platforms. Posts were scheduled every three days on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter for two weeks leading up to the event, ensuring that the content remained top-of-mind for those interested.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Collaborating with Lambda Theta Phi created additional opportunities to partner on digital projects, as members nationwide appreciated the content I created. This led to several small side projects with established chapters at other universities, providing valuable experience in communication and client service. To this day, I continue to work with the organization on occasion, assisting with promotional and creative tasks as needed.
