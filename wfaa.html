        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
            The Wisconsin Foundation and Alumni Association (WFAA) is a non-profit organization which serves the benefit of the university and its constituents. WFAA's efforts range from hosting events for students and alumni, as well as fundraising to help support the university's research, students, and faculty. My wowk with the organization began in 2019 as a Digital Experience Specialist. I built email journeys and web content to help support marketing efforts for events and fundraising campaigns. As I continued to progress in my career, I developed an interest in User Experience Design. After expressing this interest, I began to take UX-related tasks and assignments. After some time of doing that, my position as Senior Digital Experience Specialist evolved from email marketing to only user expereience, reseearch, and web content design & creation.            
        </p>
        <p>
            In the last three years, I've had a hand in designing websites from scratch, low fidelity and high fidelity wireframing, creating user stories, user research, and maintaining quality of life of our products in regards to content management and design. *ADD MORE HERE*

            This was a personal project for me. After seeing what Blue Velvet's website and logo looked like, I decided to attempt rebranding the logo to a more slick and modern look. It's an extremely simple design, as I only updated the martini glass and used the Gotham font for a professional minimalist impression. This was done early in my graphic design career, therefore revisiting it could improve it greatly.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Creating the geofilters for Blue Velvet excercised and further developed my Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop skills. I was fairly new to the graphic design world, so I did a lot of research and trial and error. All in all, it made me independent and responsible with fulfilling due dates and customer needs.
