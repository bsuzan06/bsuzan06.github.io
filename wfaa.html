        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
            The <i>Blue Velvet Lounge</i> is a small bar located in downtown Madison, WI. It is a location known by students and locals alike. The establishment was one of the first to host a Latin Night in the Madison area. On a visit to Blue Velvet, I met the owner of the bar they expressed their need for a graphic designer to do small projects when necessary. That is when I began working on Snapchat Geofilters for Blue Velvet. Eventually, I also worked on rebranding their logo.

        <h2>Snapchat Geofilters</h2>
        <div class="picGrid align-items-center">
            <img style="width: 80%; margin: 50px;" src="images/works/bvl_filters.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>
            Each filter was launched on a weekly basis in rotation. The Latin Night event was hosted every Thursday night from 9pm to 2am. The filters engagement statistics were surprisingly high due to the establishment's capacity of 160. On average, the filter was used over 300 times and viewed by over 5K users.

        <h2>Logo Rebranding</h2>
        <div class="picGrid align-items-center">

        </div>
        <p>
            This was a personal project for me. After seeing what Blue Velvet's website and logo looked like, I decided to attempt rebranding the logo to a more slick and modern look. It's an extremely simple design, as I only updated the martini glass and used the Gotham font for a professional minimalist impression. This was done early in my graphic design career, therefore revisiting it could improve it greatly.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Creating the geofilters for Blue Velvet excercised and further developed my Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop skills. I was fairly new to the graphic design world, so I did a lot of research and trial and error. All in all, it made me independent and responsible with fulfilling due dates and customer needs.
