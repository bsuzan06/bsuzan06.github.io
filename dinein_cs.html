        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
            <i>DineIn </i> is an application created to faciliate managing a restaurant. As part of a team, I followed the Agile Development Process by having two meetings a week, one for discussion and the other for code reviews. We split the development into three teams: UI/UX, Back-end, and Functionality. I was part of the UI/UX team and I contributed by creating the logo and creating the minimalist overall theme. As part of this team, I also ran several user tests to ensure the application was user-friendly. I prepared experience questionnaires, user interviews, and reviewed the results with the team. Unfortunately, the project was not fully finished due to the team disbanding.
        </p>

        <h2>Table View</h2>
        <div class="picGrid align-items-center">
            <img style="width: 50%" src="images/works/dinein_tables.png">
        </div>
        <p>
            The table view was designed based on the inputs of several local restaurants. The interview results showed that users wanted an interactive layout that could change fluidly. Once finished, the tables were able to be moved, edited, added, and deleted. The list on the side was included to facilitate adding reservations to tables as well as servers to an area of tables.
        </p>

        <h2>Punch In/Out Interface</h2>
        <div class="picGrid align-items-center">
            <img style="width: 50%" src="images/works/dinein_punch.png">
        </div>
        <p>
            The Punch In/Out interface was designed in simplicity. The design was influenced by the results gathered. The design allows users easily enter their employee ID, once entered the interface provides feedback.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Working on this project was an incredible experience. I dove into a world that I was unaware existed under the computer science umbrella. Being a part of the User Experience Design team showed me that a lot of research and sketching goes into designing the final product a user interacts with. This inspired me to pursue a career in Human Computer Interaction and Design.
